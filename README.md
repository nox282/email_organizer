# TODO
- port back backend logic
- update readme
- update license maybe
- document
- add a button to remove all selected items

# Nice to haves
- add a delete button next to selected input files to remove that specific file from the selection

# Bugs
- file input for outputfolderpath selects the first file in the folder instead of the folder itself
